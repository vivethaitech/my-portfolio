                <div class="about_content">
                    
                    <p>My name is Vivetha, and I graduated with a B.Tech in Information Technology in 2019. After completing my degree, I initially prepared for government exams. However, due to some financial issues in my family, I started working in the BPO field.

                        During my time in the BPO sector, I realized my passion and interest for returning to my core field. I took the initiative to practice front-end development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I joined a comprehensive Java course to deepen my knowledge. Now, I have a  grip on Java, and I also have knowledge of SQL.
                        <br><br>During my Java course, I had the opportunity to work as an intern trainee through Payilagam Institute where they assigned a task of recreating an institute website by collaborating with team members.Then I had a chance to edit and style one real estate website and an interior design website. After that, I work for Android app API testing in Postman using the crud operation. By using the response from Postman Api, I developed a Java bean for an Android application. In my internship, I had a chance to learn real-time work and got a chance to collaborate with task members. I used the version control system github to maintain my frontend mini projects and maintain Java codes. But in my internship, I learned to use a version control system to clone, pull, and push code in one organization repository. I am also practicing and solving programming questions in CodeChef, where I solved up to 140 questions.

                      <br><br> Apart from my technical skills, Iam also a strong communicator and team player. During my college years, I was actively involved in the Fine Arts Club, where I had the chance to develop my leadership and collaborative abilities. At my previous company, I also had the opportunity to work as a temporary team leader, further honing my leadership skills.
                        
                       In my free time, listening to music and audio stories, which helps me unwind and stay creative.</p>

                    <p>My name is Vivetha, and I graduated with a B.Tech in Information Technology in 2019. After completing my degree, I initially prepared for government exams. However, due to some financial issues in my family, I started working in the BPO field.

                       <br><br> During my time in the BPO sector, I realized my passion for returning to my core field. I took the initiative to practice front-end development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I joined a comprehensive Java course to deepen my knowledge. Now, I have a  grip on Java, and I also have knowledge of SQL.
                        
                      <br><br> Apart from my technical skills, Iam also a strong communicator and team player. During my college years, I was actively involved in the Fine Arts Club, where I had the chance to develop my leadership and collaborative abilities. At my previous company, I also had the opportunity to work as a temporary team leader, further honing my leadership skills.
                        
                       <br><br> In my free time, I enjoy singing, listening to music and audio stories, which helps me unwind and stay creative.</p>
